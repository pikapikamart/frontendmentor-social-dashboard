## My process

Hello, this is my ninth challenge here in frontend mentor and thi challenge, was the most fun , it is now, among my other challenges. It is my first time implementing a hover where I use the x and y of the cursor. It was pretty fun and challenging at the same time. Thank you if you read this one will always continue doing frontend mentor as long I have time^^^

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- FlexBox
- Grid
- Sass preprocessor

I said that I won't use any frameworks and build it from scratch to be more exciting and challenging

### What I learned

I learned in this challenge that I could implement things as long as I think logically about it. Well it kinda new to me but hey, it works^

### Continued development

I want to focus more on creating more complex designs and also designing things on my own time
